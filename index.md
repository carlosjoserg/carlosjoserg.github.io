## An unorderdered set of ideas

### On `git` branching strategies

There are several ways to manage versions in software. Or for that purpose, for anything versionable.

In one hand, there is the semantic part (AKA release system), which refers to compatibility, dependencies, API changes, and so. Probably the best example for that is the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) system. However, other rather, even rather crazy, might exist, such as the [TeX release system](http://www.texfaq.org/FAQ-TeXfuture) using the decimals of the number $$\pi$$.
